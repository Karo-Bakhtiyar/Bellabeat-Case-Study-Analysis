# Bellabeat Case Study Analysis

This repository contains the full analysis for the **Bellabeat Case Study**, which explores how users interact with Bellabeatâ€™s app and smart devices by analyzing public Fitbit tracker data.

**Project Summary**
The goal of this project is to uncover user behavior patterns related to activity, sleep, and weight tracking. By examining correlations, engagement frequency, and segmentation, the analysis highlights which features keep users engaged and where there are opportunities to improve retention.

**Key Focus Areas**

* Data cleaning and preparation of Fitbit datasets
* Analysis of the relationship between daily steps and calories burned
* Exploration of how activity levels relate to sleep duration
* Examination of user engagement patterns across activity, sleep, and weight logging
* Segmentation of users by engagement level to identify power users, casual users, and at-risk users
* Clear recommendations for product and marketing improvements to boost consistent tracking and healthy habits

**Tools Used**

* R and RMarkdown
* Tidyverse packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`, `janitor`
* Visualizations and correlation analysis
* AI-assisted support using ChatGPT to help refine code, fix bugs, and write clear documentation

**Outcome**
The final report provides insights and practical recommendations Bellabeat could apply to turn more casual users into loyal, consistent trackers by making logging easier, automating where possible, and encouraging healthy habits through incentives and personalization.
