# Bellabeat Case Study Analysis

This repository contains the full analysis for the **Bellabeat Case Study**, which explores how users interact with Bellabeatâ€™s app and smart devices by analyzing public Fitbit tracker data.

**Project Summary**
The goal of this project is to uncover user behavior patterns related to activity, sleep, and weight tracking. By examining correlations, engagement frequency, and user segmentation, the analysis highlights which features keep users engaged and where there are opportunities to improve retention.

**Key Focus Areas**

* Data cleaning and preparation of Fitbit datasets
* Analysis of the relationship between daily steps and calories burned
* Exploration of how activity levels relate to sleep duration
* Examination of user engagement patterns across activity, sleep, and weight logging
* Segmentation of users by engagement level to identify power users, casual users, and at-risk users
* Clear recommendations for product and marketing improvements to encourage consistent tracking and healthier habits

**Tools & Methods**

* R and RMarkdown
* Tidyverse packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`, `janitor`
* Correlation analysis, visualizations, and descriptive statistics
* Advanced AI assistance for code refinement, debugging, and technical writing improvements

**Outcome**
The final report provides actionable insights and recommendations that Bellabeat could apply to transform more casual users into loyal, consistent trackers by simplifying logging, automating where possible, and promoting healthy habits through incentives and personalization.
